# Munchy©

=== Please note, the program is currently in V.1 stage. Not all end features are present and bugs may exist. ===

A cooking application created for the busy individual. Munchy takes into account your preferences, health conditions, allergies, time of day and creates a tailor made list of recipes you can browse. If you can't find what you are looking for you can always manually browse through the recipes. Version 1.0 still doesn't support manual searching but I'm working on that and it will be out soon.
